# The Idea

A necessary and often overlooked part of learning mathematics is *memorisation*. Fluency and pattern recognition are greately hindered without direct mental access to concepts. Practicing active recall with spaced intervals is known to be an efficient method of memorising large amount of information. The program applies this idea to the theorem-proof structure of higher mathematics.

# Using the program

The program takes in a markdown file which should be written as a standard reference for the content. The Pandoc markdown syntax for definition lists is used to specifiy the prompt/concept structure which is parsed by the program. 

# The Implementation
